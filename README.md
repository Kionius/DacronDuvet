# DacronDuvet

A standalone game from the Black's Backbone project, created by Nathan Glynn. Features may slightly differ from the original due to using a smaller pool of plugins and some updated effects.

While the live show version of this game makes use of a MIDI drum kit as a controller, this version omits the MIDI control in favor of more-accessible keyboard controls.
